# Restaurant-rating
This data analysis project aims to analyze and draw out meaningful insights from a customer survey of restaurants in some mexican cities to aid business entrepreneurs and investors in making more informed decisions.

## Data Sources

The 5 datasets used for this analysis are 'consumer_preferences.csv, 'consumers.csv', 'ratings.csv', 'restaurant_cuisines.csv' and 'restaurants.csv'. The dictionary file 'data-dictionary.csv' was also consulted. The datasets contain detailed information about the restaurants and various information about each customer from age and marital status to preferences. It also includes an evaluation of different restaurant characterstics like parking availability, location, alcohol service, etc., and the conumers rating of their experience in these restaurants.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the customer survey data to answer key questions such as:
- What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?
- What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
- Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
- If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

## Data Analysis
The following Power BI skills were incorporated-
- DAX
- Calculated Columns
- Filters
- Measures
- Ranking
- Data Modelling


## Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The Top restaurant by number of orders is Tartosas Locas and the Top restaurant by overall ratings is Las Mananitas.

2. The things top rated restaurants have in common are that they do not allow smoking, they are non-franchise establishments, located in closed areas without parking and  moderately to highly priced menus.

3. Top Consumer preferences are;
Mexican food is the most preferred cuisine however, the top rated restaurants serve fast food, brewery, japanese and international cuisine. It is evident that cuisine preferences do not have an effect on ratings.

4. In terms of franchise, consumers mostly preffer non-franchise establishments and 3 of the 4 highest rated restaurants meet this preference which shows the effect on ratings.

5. 86% of consumers are non-smokers and the effect of this preference on ratings is evident because all the top rated restaurants do not allow smoking.

6. The top restaurants being moderately priced is commensurate with the data that 47% of consumers have a medium budget. However, consumers with a medium budget may use a high-price restaurant and rate it highly regardless

7. A majority of the consumers are casual, abstemious drinkers, this is reflected in the ratings as the top restaurants either do not serve alcohol or wine and beer menu only.

8. 62% of consumers use public transport. Thes restaurants re located in the city centre, which is highly populated and usually well connected by public trnsportation, thus the top rated restaurants do not have parking.

9. 85% of the consumers are single students in their early twenties who do not have children, live in San Luis Potosi with a low-medium budget. The majority use public transport, do not smoke but are abstemious drinkers. This causes a sampling bias as the restaurant they order from the most sells fast food at a medium price which is typical for students. 
The majority of the restaurants are from San Luis Potosi, just 1 of the 3 City samples, which also results in a low representativeness in the sample. 
There also exists another bias in that there were some incomplete responses.

9. The top 3 restaurants by consumer count have low average service ratings therefore, offering quality customer service would garner loyalty and keep any competitor restaurant at the top.

## Recommendations 
Recommedations for interested investors:

- Restaurants that are better to invest in would be Fast food cuisine with a closed area, public parking, be moderately priced, have a wine and beer menu, no smoking allowed, be non-franchise to appeal to the student population.The quality of service and food served are important as they should be excellent to in order to be competitive.

- To target the adult market, I would invest in a closed area non-franchise restaurant with a smoking section, wine and beer menu that sells mexican and international food at a medium price. It should have parking since a majority of the elderly have cars. The quality of service and food served are also important as they should be excellent to in order to be competitive.

## Limitations
I grouped age 18-29 as Young, 36-50 as Middle Aged, 51-65 as, 65+ as Elderly.
